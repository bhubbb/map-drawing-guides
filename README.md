## How It Works

### Content Extraction Process

1. **Web Scraping**: Uses requests and BeautifulSoup to fetch and parse web content

3. **Ad Removal**: Removes `<div class="mv-ad-box">` elements to clean up content
4. **Markdown Conversion**: Converts HTML content to clean, readable Markdown format
5. **Metadata Generation**: Creates structured metadata for each guide

### Search Algorithm

1. **Site Search**: Queries Easy Drawing Guides for relevant tutorials
2. **Relevance Ranking**: Sorts results by keyword relevance in titles
3. **URL Validation**: Validates each URL to ensure it's accessible before including in results
4. **Content Filtering**: Filters out irrelevant or duplicate results
5. **Source Attribution**: Clearly identifies the source of each result

### Structured Output Format

All tools return structured responses with separate blocks for:
- **Metadata**: Source, URL, content statistics, search parameters
- **Content**: Main tutorial content and descriptions
- **Instructions**: Step-by-step drawing instructions when available
- **References**: Image URLs and alt text for visual reference

## Development

### Project Structure
```
mcp-drawing-guides/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py          # Main MCP server implementation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pyproject.toml   # Project dependencies and metadata
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md        # This documentation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .venv/           # Virtual environment (created by uv)
```

### Key Dependencies
- `mcp`: Model Context Protocol framework
- `requests`: HTTP library for web scraping
- `beautifulsoup4`: HTML parsing and content extraction
- `lxml`: Fast XML and HTML parser
- `markdownify`: HTML to Markdown conversion

### Customization

The server can be easily customized by modifying `main.py`:

- **Add New Sites**: Extend the search functions to support additional tutorial sites
- **Improve Parsing**: Enhance content extraction for better step identification
- **Content Filtering**: Add custom filters for content quality or appropriateness
- **Caching**: Implement caching to improve performance and reduce server load

### Testing the Server

Test the server directly:
```bash
cd mcp-drawing-guides
uvx --from . mcp-drawing-guides
```

Or with local installation:
```bash
cd mcp-drawing-guides
uv run python main.py
```

The server communicates via JSON-RPC over stdin/stdout, so you'll need an MCP client or AI assistant to interact with it properly.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Import Errors**: Make sure all dependencies are installed with `uv sync`
2. **Network Issues**: Check internet connectivity for accessing tutorial sites
3. **Parsing Errors**: Some pages may have different structures; the server handles this gracefully
4. **Rate Limiting**: Be respectful of the source sites' server resources

### Debugging

Enable debug logging by modifying the logging level in `main.py`:
```python
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

## Ethical Considerations

- **Respect**: This server respects the robots.txt and terms of service of source sites
- **Attribution**: All content is properly attributed to its original source
- **Non-Commercial**: Intended for educational and personal use
- **Fair Use**: Extracts only necessary content for tutorial purposes

## Contributing

This is a simple, single-file implementation designed for clarity and ease of modification. Feel free to:

- Add support for additional drawing tutorial sites
- Improve content extraction algorithms
- Add caching for better performance
- Extend with additional drawing-related features

## License

This project uses the same license as its dependencies. The drawing tutorial content accessed through this server remains the property of the original sites and creators.
